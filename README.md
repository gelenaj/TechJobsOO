#TechJobs (Object-Oriented Edition)
C# / .Net Assignment


In this assignment I completed a feature that allows new Job objects to be created and added to the system working with Model and ViewModel classes 
to complete this feature.

Learning Objectives for this assignment:
-Read and understand code written by others
-Work with model classes via a data access layer (in this case, JobData)
-Use model binding and validation with ViewModel classes
-Create class extensions (that is, use inheritance)
